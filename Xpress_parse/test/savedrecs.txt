Plastics are generally not biodegradable or few are degradable but in a very slow rate. Day by day, the global demand of these polymers is sharply increasing; however, considering their abundance and potentiality in causing different environmental hazards, there is a great concern in the possible methods of degradation of plastics. Recently, there have been some debates at the world stage about the potential degradation procedures of these synthetic polymers and microbial degradation has emerged as one of the potential alternative ways of degradation of plastics. Alternatively, some scientists have also reported many adverse effects of these polymers in human health, and thus, there is an immediate need of a potential screening of some potential microbes to degrade these synthetic polymers. In this review, we have taken an attempt to accumulate all information regarding the chemical nature along with some potential microbes and their enzymatic nature of biodegradation of plastics along with some key factors that affect their biodegradability.

Aquatic plastic waste is plastic that scattered in the aquatic environment in the form of macroplastic or microplastic. Plastic production is expected to continue increasing from year to year. Due to the massive production and use of various plastic products, the accumulation of plastic waste in the environment is still increasing resulting in environmental pollution. Biodegradation is considered as the appropriate method to solve the problem. Plastics biodegradation involves various enzymes produced by plastic degrading microorganisms including algae, bacteria, and fungi. During biodegradation, plastics polymer will be converted into microbial biomass and gases through several steps including biodeterioration, biofragmentation, depolymerization, assimilation and mineralization. Thus, this process has less side effect on the environment.

They are the backbone of many industries because they are used in the manufacturing of different products including defense materials, sanitary wares, tiles, plastic bottles, artificial leather and different other household items. Plastics are also used in packaging of food items, pharmaceuticals, detergents, and cosmetics. Excessive use of plastics poses a serious threat to the ecosystem and human life on the planet. Plastics accumulation on land and sea has aroused interest to degrade these polymers. There is a need to use adequate biodegradable methods in order to reduce plastics burden from the environment. In order to overcome plastics associated environmental problems, understanding of the interaction between microbes and polymers is of prime importance. Many living organisms but predominantly microorganisms have evolved strategies to survive and degrade plastics. The present review focuses on the types of plastics on the basis of thermal and biodegradable nature, degradation and biodegradation types, types of degradable plastics, characterization of biodegradation, and factors affecting biodegradation. Plastic degradation and bioremediation potential make these microorganisms propitious for green chemistry to eliminate harmful plastics from the ecosystem. (C) 2021 The Authors.

It elevated the risk of environmental pollution and climate change. The concern arises more due to the reckless and unscientific disposal of plastics containing high molecular weight polymers, viz., polystyrene, polyamide, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, polyurethane, and polyethylene, etc. which are very difficult to degrade. Thus, the focus is now paid to search for efficient, eco-friendly, low-cost waste management technology. Of them, degradation of non-degradable synthetic polymer using diverse microbial agents, viz., bacteria, fungi, and other extremophiles become an emerging option. So far, very few microbial agents and their secreted enzymes have been identified and characterized for plastic degradation, but with low efficiency. It might be due to the predominance of uncultured microbial species, which consequently remain unexplored from the respective plastic degrading milieu. To overcome this problem, metagenomic analysis of microbial population engaged in the plastic biodegradation is advisable to decipher the microbial community structure and to predict their biodegradation potential in situ. Advancements in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analysis allow the rapid metagenome screening that helps in the identification of total microbial community and also opens up the scope for mining genes or enzymes (hydrolases, laccase, etc.) engaged in polymer degradation. Further, the extraction of the core microbial population and their adaptation, fitness, and survivability can also be deciphered through comparative metagenomic study. It will help to engineer the microbial community and their metabolic activity to speed up the degradation process.

Nevertheless, the distinct properties which make plastic desirable for our daily use also threaten our planet's sustainability. Plastics are resilient, non-reactive and most importantly, non-biodegradable. Hence, there has been an exponential increase in plastic waste generation, which has since been recognised as a global environmental threat. Plastic wastes have adversely affected life on earth, primarily through their undesirable accumulation in landfills, leaching into the soil, increased greenhouse gas emission, etc. Even more damaging is their impact on the aquatic ecosystems as they cause entanglement, ingestion and intestinal blockage in aquatic animals. Furthermore, plastics, especially in the microplastic form, have also been found to interfere with chemical interaction between marine organisms, to cause intrinsic toxicity by leaching, and by absorbing persistent organic contaminants as well as pathogens. The current methods for eliminating these wastes (incineration, landfilling, and recycling) come at massive costs, are unsustainable, and put more burden on our environment. Thus, recent focus has been placed more on the potential of biological systems to degrade synthetic plastics. In this regard, some insects, bacteria and fungi have been shown to ingest these polymers and convert them into environmentally friendly carbon compounds. Hence, in the light of recent literature, this review emphasises the multifaceted roles played by microorganisms in this process. The current understanding of the roles played by actinomycetes, algae, bacteria, fungi and their enzymes in enhancing the degradation of synthetic plastics are reviewed, with special focus on their modes of action and probable enzymatic mechanisms. Besides, key areas for further exploration, such as the manipulation of microorganisms through molecular cloning, modification of enzymatic characteristics and metabolic pathway design, are also highlighted.

J	Kathiresan, K				Kathiresan, K			Polythene and plastic-degrading microbes in an Indian mangrove soil	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL			English	Article						Rhizophora; Avicennia; plastics; polythene; degradation		Biodegradation of polythene bags and plastic cups was analyzed after 2, 4, 6, and 9 months of incubation in the mangrove soil. The biodegradation of polythene bags was significantly higher (up to 4.21% in 9 months) than that of plastic cups (up to 0.25% in 9 months). Microbial counts in the degrading materials were recorded up to 79.67 x 10(4) per gram for total heterotrophic bacteria, and up to 55.33 x 10(2) per gram for fungi. The microbial species found associated with the degrading materials were identified as five Gram positive and two Gram negative bacteria, and eight fungal species of Aspergillus. The species that were predominant were Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus (Gram +ve), Moraxella, and Pseudomonas (Gram -ve) and two species of fungi (Aspergillus glaucus and A. niger). Efficacy of the microbial species in degradation of plastics and polythene was analyzed in shaker cultures. Among the bacteria, Pseudomonas species degraded 20.54% of polythene and 8.16% of plastics in one-month period. Among the fungal species, Aspergillus glaucus degraded 28.80% of polythene and 7.26% of plastics in one-month period. This work reveals that the mangrove soil is a good source of microbes capable of degrading polythene and plastics.
