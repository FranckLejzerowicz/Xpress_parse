It elevated the risk of environmental pollution and climate change. The concern arises more due to the reckless and unscientific disposal of plastics containing high molecular weight polymers, viz., polystyrene, polyamide, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, polyurethane, and polyethylene, etc. which are very difficult to degrade. Thus, the focus is now paid to search for efficient, eco-friendly, low-cost waste management technology. Of them, degradation of non-degradable synthetic polymer using diverse microbial agents, viz., bacteria, fungi, and other extremophiles become an emerging option. So far, very few microbial agents and their secreted enzymes have been identified and characterized for plastic degradation, but with low efficiency. It might be due to the predominance of uncultured microbial species, which consequently remain unexplored from the respective plastic degrading milieu. To overcome this problem, metagenomic analysis of microbial population engaged in the plastic biodegradation is advisable to decipher the microbial community structure and to predict their biodegradation potential in situ. Advancements in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analysis allow the rapid metagenome screening that helps in the identification of total microbial community and also opens up the scope for mining genes or enzymes (hydrolases, laccase, etc.) engaged in polymer degradation. Further, the extraction of the core microbial population and their adaptation, fitness, and survivability can also be deciphered through comparative metagenomic study. It will help to engineer the microbial community and their metabolic activity to speed up the degradation process.

Nevertheless, the distinct properties which make plastic desirable for our daily use also threaten our planet's sustainability. Plastics are resilient, non-reactive and most importantly, non-biodegradable. Hence, there has been an exponential increase in plastic waste generation, which has since been recognised as a global environmental threat. Plastic wastes have adversely affected life on earth, primarily through their undesirable accumulation in landfills, leaching into the soil, increased greenhouse gas emission, etc. Even more damaging is their impact on the aquatic ecosystems as they cause entanglement, ingestion and intestinal blockage in aquatic animals. Furthermore, plastics, especially in the microplastic form, have also been found to interfere with chemical interaction between marine organisms, to cause intrinsic toxicity by leaching, and by absorbing persistent organic contaminants as well as pathogens. The current methods for eliminating these wastes (incineration, landfilling, and recycling) come at massive costs, are unsustainable, and put more burden on our environment. Thus, recent focus has been placed more on the potential of biological systems to degrade synthetic plastics. In this regard, some insects, bacteria and fungi have been shown to ingest these polymers and convert them into environmentally friendly carbon compounds. Hence, in the light of recent literature, this review emphasises the multifaceted roles played by microorganisms in this process. The current understanding of the roles played by actinomycetes, algae, bacteria, fungi and their enzymes in enhancing the degradation of synthetic plastics are reviewed, with special focus on their modes of action and probable enzymatic mechanisms. Besides, key areas for further exploration, such as the manipulation of microorganisms through molecular cloning, modification of enzymatic characteristics and metabolic pathway design, are also highlighted.

The biodegradation of polythene bags was significantly higher (up to 4.21% in 9 months) than that of plastic cups (up to 0.25% in 9 months). Microbial counts in the degrading materials were recorded up to 79.67 x 10(4) per gram for total heterotrophic bacteria, and up to 55.33 x 10(2) per gram for fungi. The microbial species found associated with the degrading materials were identified as five Gram positive and two Gram negative bacteria, and eight fungal species of Aspergillus. The species that were predominant were Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus (Gram +ve), Moraxella, and Pseudomonas (Gram -ve) and two species of fungi (Aspergillus glaucus and A. niger). Efficacy of the microbial species in degradation of plastics and polythene was analyzed in shaker cultures. Among the bacteria, Pseudomonas species degraded 20.54% of polythene and 8.16% of plastics in one-month period. Among the fungal species, Aspergillus glaucus degraded 28.80% of polythene and 7.26% of plastics in one-month period. This work reveals that the mangrove soil is a good source of microbes capable of degrading polythene and plastics.

To address this crisis, with a single remediation strategy is often found to be baseless, thereby much interest has been evoked in the development of multidisciplinary approaches - involving physico-chemical and biological strategies to nullify the aftermath of plastic pollution in all possible means. Even amidst, the availability of different approaches, the use of biological methods to combat plastic degradation has gained momentum. The most frequently used plastics appear in wide forms such as polyethylene plastic bags, polypropylene-based bottles, polyvinyl chloride pipes and polystyrene styrene cups. Plastic nicknamed as one of the toughest polymers viz. polycarbonate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and Polydicyclopentadiene; quite often are called so as they resist degradation in normal environmental strategies. They are often degraded in non-hostile and harsh environments of pH, temperature, radiation etc. However, not always it is possible to create such harsh environments for plastic degradation. In such a scenario, the use of gut microbes that can withstand the harsh atmosphere of gut environment could serve as promising candidates for plastic biodegradation. The current article envisages the various gut microbes of various biological agents and their role in plastic remediation. The current review compiles the techniques available for plastic remediation, the microbial prospects of plastic remediation, its challenges, and possible breakthroughs to effective plastic remediation.

Soil Microbial Communities Associated With Biodegradable Plastic Mulch Films	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						plastic mulch; biodegradable plastic; soil microbe community; plastisphere; plastic mulch films; plastic biodegradation	DEGRADATION; CELLULOSE; SPORES; CARBON; CROP; DNA	Agricultural plastic mulch films provide a favorable soil microclimate for plant growth, improving crop yields. Biodegradable plastic mulch films (BDMs) have emerged as a sustainable alternative to widely used non-biodegradable polyethylene (PE) films. BDMs are tilled into the soil after use and are expected to biodegrade under field conditions. However, little is known about the microbes involved in biodegradation and the relationships between microbes and plastics in soils. In order to capture the consortium of soil microbes associated with (and thus likely degrading) BDMs, agriculturally-weathered plastics from two locations were studied alongside laboratory enrichment experiments to assess differences in the microbial communities associated with BDMs and PE films. Using a combination of amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR), we observed that agriculturally-weathered plastics hosted an enrichment of fungi and an altered bacterial community composition compared to the surrounding soil. Notably, Methylobacterium, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas were enriched on BDMs compared to non-biodegradable PE. In laboratory enrichment cultures, microbial consortia were able to degrade the plastics, and the composition of the microbial communities was influenced by the composition of the BDMs. Our initial characterization of the microbial communities associated with biodegradable plastic mulch films, or the biodegradable "plastisphere," lays the groundwork for understanding biodegradation dynamics of biodegradable plastics in the environment.

However, little is known about the interactions between PMD and soil-microbe-plant systems. In this study, a pot experiment (four replicates) in tropical greenhouse was conducted to investigate the effects of PMD (polyethylene) at different concentrations (0, 0.4,0.8,4.0,6.0 g kg(-1)) on soil nutrients, rhizosphere bacterial communities and rice growth. This study further explored the interactive mechanisms between PMD and environmental factors based on correlation analysis and previous studies. The results showed that PMD continuously reduced the soil capabilities to store nutrients (C, N, P, humic-like substances) and increased the proportion of P and biodegradable dissolved organic matter (DOM). At the full ripening stage of rice growth, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in all PMD treatments significantly decreased by 60.86, 52.51 and 34.83% respectively as compared to CK (p < 0.05). Furthermore, PMD increased the total abundance of bacteria but reduced the diversity and evenness of bacterial communities, which further affected microbial metabolic functions. Total OTUs and Shannon decreased 0.02-17.05% and 0.69-7.55% in treatments. At harvest-time, PMD reduced the bio-mass and yield of rice with 1134 and 1924% (all treatments on average) lower than CK. Under the influence of PMD, the order of correlation size between PMD and one environmental factor was PMD-soil > PMD-microbe > PMD-plant, and the order of correlation between two environmental factors was soil-microbe > microbe-plant > soil-plant. Over all, PMD had the most significant negative effects on soil nutrients storage, followed by the change of microbial community structure and microbial metabolic functions. The negative effects of PMD on crops were relatively weak. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Plastic degrading ability of all selected bacterial strains was checked on nutrient agar media containing 0.1% plastic powder. After primary screening, three bacterial strains P1, P5 and P11 were selected on the basis of growth behavior. Then these three strains were checked for their ability to degrade plastic. The biochemical and morphological characterization showed that the isolates with high degradation ability belong to genus Staphylococcus.	[Jangra, Mukesh R.; Nehra, K.

Thus, development of suitable measurements for environmental remediation of plastic may be an urgent issue in this plastic age. Some recent reviews have categorized the microbial species able to degrade different plastic polymers and the different factors effecting bio-degradation of plastic are poorly understood. This review comprehensively discusses bio-degradation of traditional and biodegradable plastic polymers both in natural and biological environment (gut microbes and fungi) to understand different factors regulating their degradation, and also shows how degradation of plastic polymers under abiotic factors influence subsequent biological degradation. Different physicochemical modifications like - breaking large polymers into small fragments by pre-treatment, functional groups enrichment, identifying potent microbial species (consortia) and engineering microbial enzymes might be crucial for bio-degradations of plastic. Effects of micro/nanoplastic and other chemical intermediates, formed during the bio-degradation of plastic, on species composition, abundance, growth, metabolism and enzymatic systems of microbes involved in the bio-degradation of plastic should be determined in future research.

There is an evidence that PFM alters soil microbial populations and soil nutrients. However, how PFM altering rhizosphere microorganisms and nutrients with plant growth remain unknown. We investigated the changes of rhizosphere soil microbial metabolic characteristics in response to PFM management, and its consequent effects on soil nutrients, plant growth and yield of wheat. Methods: A field experiment of a local spring wheat cultivar Lunchun 8275 was carried out at a typical semi-arid area on the Loess Plateau. Wheat plants were treated with or without PFM, and measured for rhizosphere cultural microbial populations and microbial metabolic activities at jointing, flowering and maturity stages, respectively. Results: Rhizosphere cultural microbial populations and nutrient contents were significantly altered possibly due to the improvement of soil thermal and water status under the PFM treatment. The results of cultural microbial populations were consistent with the principal components analysis of microbial metabolic activities. PFM changed the linear regression coefficients between cultural microbial populations and nutrients, microbial metabolic activities and nutrients with 0.67 and 0.20 respectively, but with -0.24 and -0.37 in CK. Meanwhile, wheat grain yield increased by 19.2% and water use efficiency enhanced by 40.7% under PFM. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that PFM improved rhizosphere micro-environment, including soil thermal and water status, rhizosphere nutrients, cultural microbial populations and their metabolic activities, thereby increased crop yield. The present study might enhance our understanding the influence of PFM on the rhizosphere microbes and their roles in nutrient acquisition and plant growth improvement.
